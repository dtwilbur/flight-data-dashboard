"""Database configuration and session management.

This module configures SQLAlchemy for use with a local SQLite database.  For
other database engines (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.) you can modify the
`DATABASE_URL` accordingly.  The session generator can be used as a
dependency in FastAPI path functions to provide a transactional scope for
database operations.
